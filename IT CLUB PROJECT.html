             Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. 
            They are one of only a small number of species to pass the 'mirror test' – a test of self recognition.
             They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet,
             differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
